            <p id = "aboutArticle">
			I was born in Chesapeake, VA in 1997 and have lived in Rhode Island and North
			Carolina as well. I love to build, design, watch, appreciate, and make art. In
			any form. I play drumset, guitar, and marimba and have always drawn for fun. These are
			things you can expect to see articles about as well as movie reviews! I love
			movies. A cliche thing to say at the very least but I like to believe I have
			watched and written about enough movies to be serious about it. Currently all
			of my movie reviews are stored in the archives of this website so feel free to
			check them out. They are from the time that I spent as a DJ and Movie Reviewer
			at WKNC in Raleigh, NC. A few of my favorites are <em>What We Do in The Shadows</em>,
			<em>John Wick</em>, and <em>Drive</em>. Check them out and let me know what you
			think in the comments.
