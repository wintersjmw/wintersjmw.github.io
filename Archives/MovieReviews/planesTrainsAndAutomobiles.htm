            This movie was honestly just fun to watch. This movie has been around for some time and many if not all of you have already heard of if not actually watched planes trains and automobiles before. The reason I bring this movie up is that not only is it a great movie, but it does something great too. It highlights what this time of year is all about. As we get into the thick of this year’s holiday season it is always important, and maybe even cliché though that might not be totally fair, to remember why we have holidays like this. It is to spend time with family. This movie is all about that in its own funny way. The movie is definitely a little heavy on the cheese but I feel like there is just enough actual comedy and content in the movie to justify it. The comedy isn’t the only thing that backs it up though. The time of year is really what makes this movie enjoyable and fun to watch.

            This movie has done a great job of taking the formulaic approach and changing it up a bit. Which might sound slightly contradictory but I will explain. Planes trains and automobiles is a great movie for many of the same reasons that Home alone is a great movie. It is centered on fami ly values which makes it cheesy but it does a good job of covering that with a fun story. The story doesn’t have some thought provoking message or hidden meaning to it but instead it is simply a story, and I really enjoyed the story. This  It is great at pointing out the frustrations that everyone has and probably has had for the past few days with travel during the holidays. Crowded airports, stupid car accidents, and jam packed public transportation. It also does a great job of teaching some common but very important lessons. The character Del Griffith, played by John Candy, and Steve Martin’s character do a great job of teaching lessons about how to treat your fellow man or woman.

            Another great thing about the movie is its comedy. Usually I do not find the kind of forced comedy that comes in these normal guy movies funny but somehow or another this one made me laugh quite a bit. The thing I think that made it funny for me was the visual gags. The visual gags were hilariously creative and they caught me off guard every time. Planes trains and automobiles reminded me very much of the style of the movie airplane which is essentially just a movie full of visual comedy.

            With thanksgiving coming up tomorrow I think it is a great time to watch this movie. It is a family friendly comedy and if you are looking for a bit of a throwback I’d say it would be a perfect way to spend some time with your family. It reinforces good nature toward other people and really enforces the spirt of the holiday season. It may not be the greatest movie or even comedy ever made but it fits the season perfectly and does the holiday season justice.
