            Hello this is jake winters for eye on the triangle this is snowverated and this week I will be taking a look at the film Seven.
		</p>
        
        <p>
            Seven is an extremely well known movie and I tend to try not to cover these types of movies because, well, a lot of people have already seen or heard about them. But surprisingly this movie came out in 1995 which is 21 years ago at this point so I figure it is worth bringing if not for people to discover it then for people to rediscover it. Also, if you are a huge fan of House of Cards and really like Kevin Spacey in that series then you would definitely enjoy his performance in seven.

            The cast in Seven could really be considered an all-star cast. The three main actors are Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin spacey as I mentioned earlier on as well as gweneth Paltrow. There are not a whole lot of charcters besides these that really matter to the story. I think it goes without saying for the actors I mentioned that their performances will be great so there is not as much that can be said about these specific performances. I will say though that these are all definitely roles that are extremely close to others that the actors have played before. The wiseness that always follows freeman is there, and the hot head brad pitt is always there as well, and if you didn’t already guess it spacey is a weirdo. Spacey doesn’t always play weirdos but all of the characters I have seen him portray could hardly be called normal.

            The story is definitely well done and written. It flows extremely well and does a good job of never overexplaining or leading a character to find a clue without a struggle. The mystery of the movie is never really solved right up unitl the last moment of the film making it a spectacular climax and end to a wonderfully complicated chain of events. The story starts as a cop is beginning to retire and a new detective is coming on to the beat. One of my favorite things from the story of the movie is how the plot takes course over just a week. I always try not spoil things in my reviews so I will leave that to you to figure out why that is so interesting.

            The movie is on par with every other major blockbuster in terms of production. The props look real and I couldn’t even really say for sure if there is CGI in this movie or not. There are a couple of scenes that may have had CGI in them but just by saying I don’t know if there is or not says a lot about the movie. There are some great shots in the movie to help build tension as well. Information is extremely important when a film is trying to build suspense. If you give too much information there will be no suspense and if you give too little there will be no way to tell where the scene is headed and it will not be as suspenseful as it could. In a scene where suspense is high you are constantly figuring out what is going on with the help of the camera. It gives you information and you piece together what is going to happen. The final scene of the movie is a great example of withholding information from a character instead of the audience. We as a viewer see what more than one of the characters sees which means that sometimes we know something that a specific character may not know. So by controlling information the director can make the audience be help in suspense over what they think the reaction of that character is going to be. The final scene shows us the whole situation. We are left thinking what could possibly go wrong. We get an aerial and we see how wide open the scene is and how alone they are. This choice is most certainly deliberate and is well done. If they had chosen a more closed off location the events that occur would not be nearly as shocking. The movie can be a little boring leading up to this scene but it is well worth the wait.

            One thing I always feel the need to mention when talking about a film is how bloody it is and Seven is very bloody. If you have a weak stomach I would not recommend this film at all. I wouldn’t say that I have a very weak stomach and some of this film definitely made me a little sick. 
        </p>

            I am going to give this movie a 3.5/5. I can’t say that I am extremely impressed by the film because of any particular reason but I can’t say it let me down in any way either. It tells a unique story with somewhat average characters played by great actors and it never shows any signs of a lack in thought or production.

            If you want to watch this movie it is available for streaming on Amazon. Thank you for tuning in to this weeks edition of eye on the triangle and snowverated. I hope that you enjoy the rest of your evening.
