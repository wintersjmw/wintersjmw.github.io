            Hello this is Jacob Winters for eye on the triangle this is snowverated and today I will be taking a look at the film Libre et Assoupi.

            In English this films title is Nice and easy. This film is about a young man leaving college and going out into the world. He doesn’t do what most people do when they leave college, like getting a job ( or at least trying to), but instead opts for a different lifestyle. This whole movie is sort of about that choice. It speculates on ow society runs and questions if it is even running the right way. This film is set in France so it deals with some things that only their government has but the united states government has very similar programs so I found it easy to relate to the problems directly related to them.

            One of the main government programs that this movie makes point of showing how it can be abused is essentially a welfare program. In the movie is seems that France has a system set up that will provide far more than the United states will and actually allow you to live in relative comfort on just the governments tab. Obviously this is not the point of this social program but it is not impossible to imagine that it could be taken advantage of in real life as it is in the movie. The movie takes a stance on the abuse of this system in a way. At one point in the movie a person is berated for having taken advantage of the system without even trying to find a job. He is considered a burden on society. These characters accusing the other are not wrong though. They work everyday and pay taxes on their money they earn and some of it does end up going to people who do not use it to help make society a better place. In France this has an even higher implication because college is free. So when someone who is possibly college educated sits around doing nothing they are an even larger burden to society.

            The film is very fun and lighthearted about everything in it. The main character is really what propels this attitude. This truly is the way he chooses to live his life. He is always carefree and taking it easy. Hence, the title of the movie. This lightheartedness suggests that it is possible to live as this main character does, doing essentially nothing productive, and maintain a happy life. His main goal is just to learn as we hear from the very beginning of the film. The easy going attitude of the main character flows into the lives of others and it is interesting to see how different personalities mesh with it.

            This idea of having a life where your sole purpose is to learn about the world is a very appealing one to myself and I quite enjoy entertaining this fantasy through this film. It was very possible for this film to have taken the wrong route in displaying this life and leading to an impossible ending where he goes on living in this manner for the rest of his life but they instead opted for a far better ending. The movie leaves you feeling warm and happy and truly ends eing a feel good movie. All around this movie is just easy to watch and very enjoyable. There is never too much tension or awkwardness just nice, silly, and interesting situations. It does all this as well without giving up some meaning to the plot. Most feel good movies are just some heroic tale where the ending is picture perfect and while the ending could be considered perfect in this case I love how it was built up to. They did a great job of fitting the ending to the style.

            I am going to give Libre et Assoupi a 8/10. The writing of this film is really what stands out to me. They do a great job of making te whole film feel as relaxed and down to earth as the main charcter himself is. You will never feel stressed or worried through the film for long if ever, and it will leave you with a new perspective on life. The greatest thing about this movie in my opinion is its interesting take on life. It is one I had never thought of or heard of and I found it very interesting to be just discovering it and then also begin to explore it to the film. It is not some revolutionary new way to live but it is simple and interesting
