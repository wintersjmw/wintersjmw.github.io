            I have been recommended this film more times than I can count but have always had a little something against black and white movies. I have seen movies in black and white that I have really enjoyed like 12 angry men and the rear window but something always stops me from seeking them out. Some part of me thought that color films were in some way superior. I guess I just always figured that if the movie industry moved away from black and white filming there was a really good reason. Well it probably was really just that with color there is a lot more you can show in a film that will be understood by the audience. When filming in black and white there are a lot of extra considerations that go into the filming of it. Actors wear exaggerated make up and the scenes often have high contrast colors so they don’t blend together on the screen. Black and white films are a whole different ball game as compared to color films. A lot of techniques transferred over to color when the industry moved that way but a lot were lost too. There are many techniques that have no real use in color film that were once powerful in black and white film. The main point I am trying to get across here is that the two whould almost be considered different genres. They are from a different time, tell stories in a different way, and use techniques that fall into obscurity in the modern age of film.

            Psycho is a classic. If you consider yourself a film buff you’ve certainly heard of it if you haven’t already seen it. In my segment I try to look at films people have forgotten and this is certainly not a film that will be forgotten any time soon, but how many people have actually watched the movie. Well, tons, Tons of people have seen this movie. Probably every film student in the past 50 years and it was also a immensely popular movie when it was released. This movie has gotten its fair share of exposure I would say, but if you ask 10 or 15 people now to get a feeling for how many have seen this movie the number would probably be below 10, of course this depends on who you ask but let’s just assume they represent the general public. This is why I bring this film to my review. I watched it not intending on talking about the film but after seeing it I could not help myself. This film is simply a masterpiece. An antiquated masterpiece yes but that has never stopped people from enjoying the film before let alone any other type of antiquated art.

            The movie was directed by Alfred Hitchcock in and was released in 1960. The film was the most profitable of hitchcock’s career and it certainly is not surprising. I can’t even begin to comment on how this film could be improved because I simply have nothing to add. Ok maybe I can say that the filming was a little shaky at times but how can the film crew be blamed for that. They got amazing shots with the equipment they had and the fault of shaky cameras hardly falls on them. If you really wanted to give them even more leeway you could say that it was a stylistic choice made to keep the audience in an even deeper state of uneasiness The one thing I can say is that it is most certainly a film of its time period. Sometimes a film comes before its time and sometimes after but Psycho hit the nail right on the head. Maybe it even created the time period of film that it was in because of how influential it was.

            The acting, oh man I love the acting in this movie, offputting may not even be the right word for it and maybe rather disturbing on the surface and devilish below it. The man playing the psycho is instantly a huge creep. He stares and pauses just a little too long but almost unnoticeably so. Your subconscious tells you something is wrong and when you look for it it is almost as if it was never there. He gets more deranged as the film continues though and of course it becomes far more noticeable. The psycho took the cake for acting in this movie but all major characters had there quirks and lines that were oh so well done. Of course there is no acting without writing and this film’s story has it all. It does not care for its characters, meaning there is no plot shield, and it leads you astray but guides you along at the same time. The acting and writing of this film fit well enough to make the insane characters of this film believable when you are not likely to come across anyone like them in your lifetime.

            I am sure that it is not possible for me to give this movie a thorough look at this film in the scope of just one segment. The only thing I can say to truly encapsulate this film is to recommend this film with the highest score I can give it. So I am giving this film a 5/5. This may be the only film I ever give this score and I think that is rightfully so. It has replaced my favorite film and it is not even in my favorite genre. I cannot recommend this film enough if you are looking for something to keep you on the edge of your seat with anticipation and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was simply a master of his craft.
