            Hello, this is Jake Winters with Eye on the Triangle with your weekly movie review. This week will be a review Catch Me Daddy. The film was released this year on the seventh of august. Catch me Daddy was directed by Daniel Wolfe, an English director, who had only previously directed short films. Mentioning that his only previous work was short film should not imply that he was only directing small projects. In one of his more well-known films, entitled The Shoes: Time to dance, Jake Gyllenhaal plays the main role. The film premiered at the Cannes film festival in France in 2014. It was then released in theatres in Britain in 2014 and then on to the US theatres this year. Catch Me Daddy falls is an intense story of a girl trying to avoid her father. It doesn’t take long for this thriller to become thrilling as there is an air of suspense right from the beginning of the film.

            The film begins by presenting the audience with an over view of a girl’s life. She lives in a trailer home outside of the city she works with her boyfriend. There the two take drugs together and despite that they are not in the best circumstances seem to be enjoying their lives. The trouble starts when some people begin investigating her life and trying to kid nap her. The story while being simple in nature is also very complex. It is a very common story a person running away from their problems only to have them later catch up with themselves. The thing that separates this telling from the next is the character development.

            The boy that the girl is with is a main character but they could have left his life prior to the current story completely out of the film but the writers chose not to. Character development within Catch Me Daddy gets across the moral of the story. Even minor characters have depth to them. We see the driver of one of the groups preparing to leave in the morning, and in another scene we are shown a man at the mall with his baby getting a glass hologram made of them together. The film intentionally tries to point out the humanity in these characters. They aren’t just henchmen working under some powerful boss. They are instead people trying to get by to support their lifestyles. Even when the older man goes to his drug dealer’s house we can get a sense for who the drug dealer is. When the audience initially sees the dealer he is playing online poker so we know the man is a gambler. The dealer also has enough trust in the older man to let him buy while only promising to pay the next day. So just from his action we can get a feeling for the character. Another key in the development of this minor character is the decoration of his apartment. He lives in a relatively small apartment. His living room consists of a television and a couch along with a pet snake in the corner of the room. When the characters enter into the kitchen there is a large family portrait hanging on the wall. This once again shows that the dealer is human. He is trying to support a family.

            The filming of this movie is pleasing and very enjoyable. Robbie Ryan, the cinematographer for the film worked most notably on Philomena in the past. The most apparent sot the film constantly does is to take shots from a far where the action of the scene becomes insignificant to the camera’s eye. This happens mostly at the beginning of the film when the setting is still becoming clear to the audience but this style of shot remains throughout the film. One of the most significant times this style of shot is used is during a meeting of two groups that the story has been following. We are shown the two cars parking and then the long distance shot begins. We don’t hear what the parties say keeping the meaning of the meeting still vague to the audience.

            The ever present feeling of demise is kept alive by the sound and setting of the movie. Although the character’s lives are simple and there is not much going on. The deep rumbling of bass during a rain storm gives a hint to the underlying tension within their lives. There is rarely ever music playing for the entirety of the film providing a tension to the everyday lives of the characters in the opening scenes. Every sound is heard, and when there is no sound there is a stillness. This stillness provides the suspense even in situations where normally there would just be a calm. The weather throughout the film is never pleasant. It is always cloudy and if it’s not just cloudy it is raining.  As with any time the weather is bad it puts a damper on the mood. Making the feeling almost gloomy throughout the duration of the film.

            I try not to spoil the movie for listeners in this review but I have to mention the ending. The way the story starts is very similar in the manner in which it ends. Suddenly. As if we were allowed a certain amount of time to watch this girls tragic life and our time ran out at a key moment. Like running out of quarters at an arcade the audience is left with nothing beside their imagination to continue the story. In some ways this is the best way for any story to end. People can fill the ending with what they like and therefore they can enjoy it. I wouldn’t say this is the reason they ended the film the way they did but as not to spoil anything I will not go into further detail.

            I enjoyed this film. I feel that many movies in the same vein tend to focus on action to provide suspense. Here the writers chose unpredictability in the characters. It is hard to tell what is going to happen next and Catch Me Daddy will keep you on guard for the whole film. This movie is available to be rented online and I would recommend you do so if you are looking for an interesting movie.
