		Hello this is jake winters for eye on the triangle this is snowverated and today I will be 
		taking a look at the film A Most Violent Year. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		A most violent year came out in 2014 and was nominated that year for a Golden Globe. It 
		didn’t win the award but that doesn’t really stand to show how impressive of a film it
		really was. I had not heard of this film before I watched it but got the recommendation in
		some way I can’t remember. This movie really was fantastic but it had some flaws that I can
		understand keeping it from winning awards.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The acting in A Most Violent Year had its weak points near the beginning of the film. It is
		understandable though because being cast for someone who is supposed to be in a state of 
		almost misery and then having to play them as a content character is a test of range. They
		were given a lot to work with though because the characterization that comes from lines in 
		the film add a lot to character without a whole lot of acting. Throughout a most violent 
		year, I enjoyed how true the main character in the film stayed to himself. He held virtue 
		above everything else and you could see how his values were going to topple him. How 
		carefully the cards were put in the place to challenge the character, just enough for him 
		to grow without losing it all in the end.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Filming in the movie was done extremely well. The used the frame to their advantage in so
		many cases to keep the audience from seeing exactly what was going on and keeping us on the
		edge of our seats. One scene in particular where the main character is up in the night
		looking for someone as he followed his dog at first and then led through the house the
		camera followed from afar. It gave the scene a sense of focus because we had to be so
		focused to see and understand what was going on in our field of vision. They used the camera
		with this expertise throughout the movie. There are a few beautiful shots of New York city
		in this film and though the city to
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I felt A Most Violent year relied slightly too heavy on archetypes in certain situations to
		guide the script but that really wasn’t too unwelcome of a tactic for this film to use in
		creating drama. The story is still captivating and creates a world that these charcters fit
		into. They never tell you a lot about the background of the story and mainly you as the 
		viewer are left to figure it out. This manner of story-telling takes a lot more effort on 
		the part of the people designing the set. There have to be clues in the beginning of the 
		film to give the setting instead of them outright saying who they are. Speaking of which the
		dialogue in the movie is so well written and they were able to stay so true to character and
		they let it impact the story in major ways. Instead of there being one plotline that almost 
		certainly has to happen it doesn’t seem like this movie has any direction. They end up 
		somewhere pretty close t where they started which is the weirdest part about this movie. It
		is one of those movies that you know the story will continue but we will never get to see
		the end of it. Maybe they will make a sequel they certainly could and I be right there to 
		see it too. If they were to make a sequel I think that they would be able to clean up a lot 
		of the style and fill in gaps in characters that remain. It would fix a lot of what I feel 
		is wrong with the movie so I really hope they do go on to make a sequel.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The film did a great job of telling a story so that I didn’t feel like I was bored and 
		seeing set up for most of the movie. Every movie needs to have ups and downs but having a
		lot of down time usually ends in a boring movie. This movie was full of suspense until the
		moment it ended. Sometimes it is hard to make it through movies even though they are
		interesting. They still get your interest but if you aren’t in a theatre like the majority
		of people watching movies there is nothing keeping you focused on the screen beside the
		stories captivation. This movie was hard to look away from for even a little because I 
		always felt I had missed something if I did. A most violent year was truly a captivating 
		film and I was glued to the screen.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I am going to give A Most Violent Year a 4/5 because it had everything I want from a movie
		but it almost felt like the movie wasn’t long enough. Even though it was two hours long. I 
		guess if they had managed to give a little more personality and not so much obvious dialogue
		and plot shifts to some of the side characters it could have been a little more satisfying.

		Thank you for listening to this weeks edition of eye on the triangle and snowverated. Im 
		Jake Winters enjoy the rest of your evening
