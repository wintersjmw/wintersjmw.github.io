            Hello this is Jacob Winters for eye on the triangle this is snowverated and today I will be taking a look at the film seven psychopaths.

            Seven psychopaths was released in 2012 and it to me it gained muc less attention than it was due. That is why I am bringing it to your attention today. This film is honestly a very unique story. It has elements of a Tarentino film with its gore and storytelling methods but it is stands alone in its style. I have never seen a film that borrowed from Tarentino well enough that I did not feel like it was just copying him. I actually enjoyed how they interpreted and changed the style and the resulting story was very entertaining and unique.

            The story follows a writer while he is writing a new book called the seven psychopaths and throughout it seems that as much as his life is affecting his story it sometimes seems that his life is his story. I am not sure if this was an intended result of the way the story is told but it is an interesting effect. The main character’s best friend is attempting to help him write his story and gets so caught up in writing it he attempts to bring parts of his vision to life. This brings about what might be an unintended consequence of questioning whether or not the character knows that he himself is within a story.

            Colin Farrell plays the lead role in this movie, You may know him from the lead role in In Bruges, and did a fantastic job. Colin Farrel is a far underrated actor. I wish he had the chance to star in more big blockbuster films because I really enjoy his talent. He plays similar characters in these two films but even if he only did that one type of character I think I would still enjoy his films because of his ease in playing it.

            The major key of the story telling that I enjoyed was the little side stories that developed from the main character writing his story. The came as others telling him stories or suggesting edits to ones that he had come up for. The first scene in the movie is one of this nature and initially throws you off. That scene is what had me questioning what was and wasn’t a part of the main story for the rest of the film. It was pretty obvious most of the time but some of the outlandish parts had me questioning what was real. You could almost make the argument that just as in fight club (spoiler warning don’t listen if you haven’t seen the movie this will ruin the whole thing and its great) all of the side characters are in the main characters head. I mean once the true nature of the side charcters is revealed there is almost too much of a coincidence for them not to be at least somewhat augmented by his imagination.

            There nothing that truly stood out in the film in terms of innovation or really spectacular shots. They could have experimented more with the filming and I wish they did. It is always a shame when films don’t take advantage of their medium. That being said the things that stood out about the film were the characters, who were all unique, and the general believability of the strange things that occurred in the film. The well written plot doesn’t ever really throw a huge turn around or reveal into the mix but instead has a steady build up with a small drop off. I became attached to the characters and enjoyed their stories. They ended up all being intertwined in a satisfying way and left a side character far more developed and intricate than the main character.

            I am going to give this film a 6 out of ten. I felt that it dragged on and the story could have been around 2/3 of the lengt that it ended up being. It is possible that they originally had a much longer script and cut it down to this size but if that was the case I think they needed to edit out a little more. There is a little too much intricacy to the story. It becomes overly complicated. Other than the length and lack of variety in the style of its cinematography I quite liked this film. The story was original and the characters were oddly believable.
