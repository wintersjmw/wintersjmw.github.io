            Hello this is Jake Winters for Eye on the Triangle this is Snowverated and this week I will be taking a look at Borgman.

            Borgman is a 2013 movie that explores evil. The movie is odd to say the least. It is hard to ever say what it is truly about and there is so much confusion that it seems like it would be completely uninteresting and boring. Somehow though it was still captivating. There is hardly any music, which gives it an eerie tone, and all of the events are left mostly unexplained. The thing that keeps you watching in this films case is the oddity of it, or at least that is what did it for me. I was intrigued by the beginning of the film thinking it was some sort of modern magicianâ€™s tale but it just got more confusing as the film went on. This was a little frustrating at times when I felt it went too far into unexplained or unexplainable subject matter, this un-explainability lent itself to the eeriness of the film though.

            Symbolism in this movie is such a regularity it almost seems as if they put it in just to confuse the viewer.  While I was watching the movie I found myself constantly trying to figure out what the film could be a metaphor of or what it was trying to represent. The only thing I will say about the conclusion I came to is that it is biblical. I recommend going and looking up a few interpretations of the film afterwords because some of them are pretty interesting and insightful

            The way the film was shot was very standard. All of the camera angles were very predictable and precise and it was enjoyable to see such a crisp well done film. There was use of symmetry for some sort of symbolism, which like I mentioned is rampant if you choose to interpret it that way. I always seem to pick out one way that the film uses the camera that I really enjoy. In this one it has to do with searching for something. The character that the camera is following goes into the shed in a third person view and once in the shed it immediately switches to a first person view. This puts the viewer into the shoes of the character and that creates a suspense since you are now personally searching the scene for something out of the ordinary. Another thing to mention about the flming of the movie is that is just feels smooth. When Borgman is being chased in the opening scene it never feels rushed. It always feels under control just barely and he always gets away by a tiny little margin. I love the feeling this gives it is like you want him to get away so you are rooting for him and you want him to be rushed and he is just so nonchalant and confident.

            The movie is rated R. There are a few scenes that I found extremely disturbing for how violent and pointless they seemed. The dreams Borgman gives to the Marina in the movie are particularly disturbing and out of the ordinary. Another notable feature of the film is that the languages spoken are a mix of English and Dutch. This combination would sound normal to anyone from the Netherlands Belgium or Denmark but it is wuite odd to hear so casually used as a native English speaker. This only adds to the uneasy feeling of the movie, maybe unintentionally, but I really liked what it made the movie feel like.

            The movie says a lot about evil that is very plain to see. They ill people like it is nothing. They discuss for maybe a few seconds and then they do it. Without any remorse removing people they need gone in a surgical way. True evil, which I believe Borgman represents in this, has no real reason or purpose. It simply destroys and leaves. Borgman has no reason other than needing a shower to come into these peoples lives and he ends up completely destroying them.

            I am going to give this movie a 7.25/10. I really enjoyed it but I think it is a niche film. If you like thinking about a film and then having to look up what someone else thought it meant after you will like this because it is just that. Another way that someone could enjoy this is just to view it as an extremely abstract horror film. There are no jump scares or monsters, well at least fictional monsters, but I could definitely see this movie leaving you with a nightmares.
