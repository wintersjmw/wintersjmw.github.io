            Hello this is Jake Winters for Eye on the Triangle this is Snowverated and this week I will be taking a look at The film The Fifth Element.
		</p>

            The fifth element is a sci-fi slash fantasy movie set in the distant future. This movie is more well known the most of the movies I review on the show but in spirit of the upcoming holiday, valentine’s day I figured I would try and find a movie that fits the holiday’s spirit but does not have the stereotypical characteristics of a Valetine’s day movie. I think I was able to find that with the fifth element.

            Many sci fi movies are about war and action in a distant future, and while there is a lot of action in the fifth element, it does a good job of creating a really interesting world and narrative. All of the technology and culture in the movie can sort of be taken as fact, which comes from the way the scenes characters and props are designed. They do not make a huge show of pointing out some huge futuristic society, I mean it is noticeable but I feel like that aspect of the film can sort of be forgotten pretty easily as it becomes the setting pretty quickly. This allows the fifth element to tell a story in this strange setting without having to explain it.

            The story becomes a basic good verse evil after the introduction to the plot, which is rather long, is played out. I think the simplicity of the story and the simplicity of its message is one of the great things about the fifth element. Even though it is very simple there is a lot to love about the movie. The characters are interesting, the setting is intriguing and complex, the backstory is complete and creates a good base for the movie, and the action sequences are not too overdone. So essentially this movie was just well done.

            When I say the story is simple I mean that really there is a laid out goal. the good guy is defined and sort of stereotypical and the bad guy is the same way. This gives the movie a basic platform upon which to build its narrative. Overall the story is a little complicated but it is also very easy to follow which makes it easy to watch and just enjoyable. I never really felt bored during the movie because it was also good at building tension and suspense. The unpredictability of any movie is what keeps you watching but in the case of action scenes it becomes even more important as it will completely draw the viewer into the stress of the situation.

            I really enjoyed how well set up the movie is. They took a lot of time making sure there wasn’t just some unexplained apocalyptic event setting all of this in motion and layed a basis for the characters before proceeding with the plot. This attention to detail is what takes the basic platform that the movie is built on and adds a level to it.

            The level of originality in the details of this movie are what made the universe feel so real and futuristic. The style is unique enough that the universe could exist on its own. The costume design is iconic in the sci fi world. The bandages that leeloo, the main female wears, has become a popular costume for big sci fi events. Partly because it is very simple. The prop design in the movie is also great. It slightly reminded me of total recall, another famous 90’s sci fi movie, in design. The cop cars and uniforms of all the surroundings creates an overall sense of setting. It makes flying cars seem so normal you don’t even notice them anymore. Like if you had seen a flying just randomly in a 20th century neighborhood or city it would just seem so out of place. The fifth element does a good job of making everything just slightly bizarre and futuristic that noting seems out of place.

            The great thing about this movie as a choice for Valentine’s Day is that you won’t feel like it is a Valentine’s Day movie until the end. I personally have never liked overly romantic movies and this is a way to escape that and still get a nice message about love and be entertained by something other than just a couple bonding over random romantic moments. Don’t get me wrong though those types of movies have their time and place and I think it is safe to say that that time is valentine’s day but if you are looking for something a little different from usual and either have never seen or heard of the fifth element or just needed tis reminder that it exists and is a fantastic movie that you could introduce to someone I think that the fifth element is a good choice.

            I am going to give this movie a 7/10 for being enjoyable and original. I really enjoyed the message it sent by the end of the movie and I highly recommend this as it is definitely among my favorite sci fi movies.
