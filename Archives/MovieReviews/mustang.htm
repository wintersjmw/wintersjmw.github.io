            Mustang is a Turkish film directed by Deniz Gamze Erguven. The movie shows the life of five orphan girls who live with their grandmother and uncle. The story revolves arund the girls rebeliious actions and follows them as they are moved through the conservative culture of Turkey.

            As with any foreign film culture is always a main interest of mine. I look to see how the culture functions and whether or not it represents the majority of that country. For example if someone were to look at a movie like The Town and assume that was what Boston was like in general they would have a very skewed idea of that city. While crime is definitely present what is shown in the movie is far out of the normal range of activity. It is important to realize this when watching films from other countries because almost certainly the representation you see will be a dramatization of real life. Another aspect changed by the film being a foreign one is the language. Translation is never perfect and some aspects of a movie spoken in foreign language will always be mis-translated in some way or another. Maybe the context isn’t quite right or the grammar is incorrect in English. This affects how natively englis speaking audiences will perceive and receive the film.

            The filming of this movie was very well done. They often took advantage of their setting in showing the happenings of the sisters. They used trees to obscure faces when running in the woods and in the house when they were chasing each other around inside the house doors out into hallways and connecting rooms accentuate the setting of the house and create an interesting visual instead of having the normal chase down a hallway that they could have. At another moment in the film the girls are sent down an alley to be away from their relatives while they are served at a restaurant. This is a very awkward situation and the filming shows that by looking down the alley toward the relatives creating distance between them through the eye of the camera. The film had a warm but bright feeling in terms of color through the movie, which in many ways contrasted the story. They set upsetting scenes during the evening most often and almost all others during the day time not taking too much advantage of natural lighting. The house they filmed was sizeable and nice which also contrasted the situation the girls were in. This was most likely a choice of representing the culture correctly instead of being a symbol.

            The movie altogether seemed a little disjointed. There were almost too many charcters to keep up with which is what makes me question the five girls’ choice. They never really focus on any one of the girls for very long and instead sort of represent them as a unit. The youngest girl is around the longest but this is purely because of the older ones moving on with their lives. She could be said to be the min character but I would not say she is the only main character. A lot of what doesn’t make sense about this film to me may come from a lack of cultural understanding of Turkey but it seems there are two sides to the culture. There are very conservative people who still believe in arranged marriages and wives as almost household worker and then there are those that are educated and free to do what they want. The conservative culture for the girls was oppressive as they did not enjoy living within it and it actually felt like the rest of the people in the village felt that the girls situation was very odd as well. The story basically followed the girld as they were locked up and assimilated into a culture they had no wish to be in but didn’t show this happening in a very understandable manner. It focused to heavily on their actions and not enough on the emotions that the girls had. Of course they did show some distress but it all seemed very childish and only on the surface. This could be in part due to the actors playing the charcters but they did not seem alive.

            Mustang shows how this group of five orphan girls growing up in a culture the detest fight against it. I found the story to be an interesting cross section of the culture but it lacked the emotion needed to carry you through what should be a completely emotional journey. I have watched other foreign films and have been engaged but this one was not able to seal the deal.
