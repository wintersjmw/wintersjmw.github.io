            Hello this is jake winters for eye on the triangle. This is snowverated and today I will be taking a look at the film Hail Ceaser.

            Hail Ceaser was released February 1st of this year and is the latest of the Coen Brothers films. If you vaguely remember hearing the Coen Brothers for allow me to elaborate. These men are the same men that brought us Fargo the Big Lebowski O brother where art though, and the list goes on.

            My feeling is that when you go into a movie you should never have any expectations of it. You may have seen the trailer you may have even read a little about the story but before you have seen the movie there is no real way to jud nothing really comes close ge it. Going into my viewing of Hail Ceaser I wanted a Coen Brothers film. They have such an iconic style and it is so pleasing to watch. I really just wanted this to be another hit like all coen brothers fans did. Unfortunately I can not say that this film was a hit. It failed to really impress me in most ways. Their style of filming was still there and the world that they had created was obviously made for their style of story telling but the story itself was just uninteresting. It didn’t seem like it had any real direction and the side stories and characters had a minimal effect on the main plot in the film. This always  makes the plot feel flimsy. There is just so much going on and you are constantly trying to figure out how it all relates. In many cases that can be a good thing such as a movie like the big Lebowski. There are multiple side stories involving the main character which ties them all together. We just follow the life of Jeff Lebowski for a few days and at the end some major things happen that tell us the film is over. In Heil Ceaser we get a bunch of scenes with different characters, none of which really stand out as a main character, and a lot of the side stories end up relating to the main story but a lot of it really does not matter at all. By comparing two of their movies it becomes much more apparent which movie is worse.

            It would be unfair though only to say bad things about this movie. There are some redeeming qualities. The acting is very well done. Another trademark of the Coen Brothers are their all-star casts. Not every character is a huge actor but the main characters are usually recognizable. The way in which the Coen brothers write their eccentric charcters makes them need very talented actors. So, it isn’t exactly necessary for the Coen brothers to use Famous actors but many of them also happen to be very good actors whether many would like to admit that or not. Acting in Hail Ceaser almost could not have been done better. It almost highlights how incongruous the story is when the actors play their parts to a tee and the narrative just won’t fit together.

            My favorite of the many performances in the movie was Chaning Tatum. I think it is fair to say that many people discount Chaning Tatum as an actor. He seems like another pretty face of Hollywood with only that going for him from the outside but in reality he really does have talent. You get glimpses of it in movies like 21 jump street and Magic Mike where the plots are little thinner and don’t really allow actors to do a lot of development with their characters but in hail ceaser with a plot that is too dense there is not enough the actors can do to make their charcters more eccentric and personal. Seeing Chaning Tatum act in a role I would have never pictured him in was one of the more enjoyable moments of Hail Ceaser.

            Overall the movie is watchable and really not the unpleasant to watch but nothing ever really concludes in it. There is a conclusion to the story but it feels like such an open ending not to mention loose ends in the movie. It is almost like the realized after writing the film that they didn’t like it anymore and weren’t able to give it a satisfying ending. Or it could have been that they wrote different characters stories and then in the end attempted to bring them together and failed. In any case the movie definitely did not meet its potential. I had high hopes for the next Coen brothers film and was let down.

            I am going to give this movie a 2 out of 5. Everything about the movie was there beside the story. They had all the funding and staff to make a great movie and in some ways they did but something is lacking in hail ceaser for sure. It is hard to say what is really missing in the plot overall but whatever it was made the whole thing fall apart.
