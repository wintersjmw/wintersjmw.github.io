            Hello this is jake winters for eye on the triangle this is snowverated and this week I will be taking a look at the film the hudsucker proxy.

            Hudsucker proxy was written by the Coen brothers along with their frequent collaborator Sam Raimi. I have taken a look at another film by the Coen brothers which you may remember as being Hail Ceaser. Hail ceaser definitely isn’t a far cry away from this film but  I think that this film was ever so slightly more enjoyable. After watching this movie though I realized a lot about the way in which hail ceaser was meant to be viewed. Both movies don’t do take the usual route of analyzing characters lives and personalities but instead use the characters as a tool in order to draw a caricature of an industry or idea. This idea is frankly extremely refreshing as usually even in movies that show the corruption of an industry charcters lives become the main focus. This movie plays more like a fictional dramatization of how the authors view the real world. It is hilarious if you view it from this point, but if you don’t know to take it from that perspective it becomes boring. You look. for development in the character where there is none and miss the world changing around him. And when I say that there is no character development I really do mean none. The characters are not the focus of the movie and that is apparent. This is also what threw me off from it at first and really the same goes for hail Ceaser. Hail Ceaser definitely has more interesting charcters and honestly that makes it a better movie. This movie may even have convinced me to change my score on Hail Ceaser which I am usually very opposed to doing.

            Because the movie is made by the Coen brothers going in it is very hard for me not to have expectations. I expect the filming to be great and I expect the characters to feel alive and full of emotion. Of course even though the charcters didn’t develop extremely well throughout the story the Coen brothers habit of working with well known actors played its role in making even just the performances entertaining. Of course every actors performance has something to do with the director they have so the Coen brothers get credit here as well. The main actor, Tim Robbins is probably best known for his role in the Shawshank redemption. He plays andy dufragne. I hadn’t seen him in anything else beside the Shawshank redemption and I was wondering throughout the whole movie who it was. Well, as in Shawshank redemption his performance has hardly any flaws. The only thing that could really be said is that he over acted at some parts and made it feel a little cheesy. But, that is who his charcter was. An actor trying to fit a role he was hardly prepared for.

            It took me quite a while after watching this movie to come to have some kind of appreciation for it. I wondered for a long time why the coen brothers would make a movie like this. They make such great movies and a few among their many films just seemed like duds to me. Why weren’t those movies good. Why would they waste time making a film if they didn’t see it developing into something amazing like many of their films. Of course I thought maybe everyone has a bad day but it seems to me directors and writers like the coen brothers would release their movie was bad and not release it before losing 28 million on a single film. Which the hudsucker proxy did with some reports of the losses being even higher. I realized they were just making a different kind of movie that many directors wouldn’t ever make. This really is what the coen brothers do best. They don’t seem to care what audiences want and instead make art that appeals to themselves. This is truly commendable and I am glad they did this. They have opened my eyes to a world of film possibilities I didn’t realise were their. I am sure there are many movies like this that I haven’t seen before and I will look at a lot of films in a different light having seen this. Especially hail ceaser as it is so similar in style to the hudsucker proxy.

            I really did not enjoy the hudsucker proxy while I watched it. It was boring and I found it hard to make it through the movie without talking about how much I wanted it to end. I stuck it out to the credits though and I am glad I did. The film takes a twist at the end and it is a spectacular one, giving the movie its real meaning and putting a period on the thesis that brought this movie to life. I come out of seeing this movie with a new perspective on film and I thank the coen brothers for that.

            I am going to give this movie a 3 out of 5. I can see how the majority of people did not like this film. A lot goes on but not much really happens. I am not too sure how to explain that sentence but after watching I would love to know if anyone knows what I mean. The movie had fantastic filming, writing and acting and is deceptively bland on the surface. Once realizing what could almost be called an extended metaphor is present throughout the film it is far more enjoyable. It could possibly be one of the few films that is better on a second viewing.
