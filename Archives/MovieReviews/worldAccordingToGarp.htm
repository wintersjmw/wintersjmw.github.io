            Hello this is Jake winters for eye on the triangle this is snowverated and this wek I will be taking a look at the film World according to Garp.

        <p>
            Recently by some chance or another I have come across a few movies of Robin Williams that I had never heard of. World according to Garp is one of the better movies of Robin Williams in my opinion. Of course there are his classics like flubber and Mrs. Doubtfire and those aren’t necessarily easy roles either but when you really get deep into his work as an actor you can see just how varied he was.

            The film follows the main charcter played by robin Williams through his childhood all the way through his adulthood. The movie was touching but wasn’t afraid to go off into the weirder side of life. Movies that acknowledge the world as flawed are always better then ones that choose to live in the surreal normality that Hollywood has created for some reason or another. Of course there are never truly normal movies otherwise they would bore people to death but a lot of times the problems are artificial and don’t really feel real. Of course there is a place for every type of movie and there is not really anything wrong with movies that are made that way but the depth that comes from imperfection and honest imperfection at that seems to always have a longer lasting impact.

            I wasn’t really sure what to expect when I started watching the movie as I was primarily watching to see something by Robin Williams that I haven’t seen before. The movie reminded me of Benjamin button a little in the way it followed an outcast person with a weird backstory through their whole life. There are so many small conflicts that come and go and really the film seems like just a collection of short stories, in much the same way that the average person’s life is divided into sections. In stories people often have just one up and down but that really is never how life goes. It is up and down for anybody’s whole life. There is almost never one adventure with one ultimate goal but rather a series of adventures with varying goals and aspirations. It is hard not to think about your own life when someone else’s, whether fictional or not, is portrayed well. You see things they could have done and think about the things that maybe you should have done 5 years ago.

            World according to Garp is all about the characters in the movie and I really liked almost all of them for one reason or another. His mother was eccentric but true to herself and she gave others the voice to do that and his family in general were just charming and interesting enough. The writer for the movie did a great job of making Garp just weird enough that he could have been raised by his mother and everything else falls into place around that.

            Nothing was extremely spectacular about costumes or filming but that is not really a bad thing. When you can’t notice a film for its filming or costumes that means everything fits, and when everything fits that means it was done right. It is easy to forget just how much work probably went into the lighting and make up for any movie because of just how well the people in those fields do their jobs working on big pictures such as this one.

            There is nothing extremely phenomenal about this movie but know that it isn’t afraid to surprise you and catch you off guard. You will get attatched to garp through his charming demeanor and root for im through the movie and when it comes to the end youll still be on his side but youre view of him is so different from the beginning. The movie did a great job of taking characters as they were young and moving them into adulthood something that takes a lot of skill to do.

            I am going to give this movie a 3.5/5. I lived the story and charcters and overall it was a great movie. It wasn’t an astounding work of film but it was entertaining, mildly thought provoking and heartwarming all at the same time.
