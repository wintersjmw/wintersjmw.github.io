            Hello this is Jake Winters and today I will be giving my review of Cop Car.
		</p>
		
        <p>
            Cop Car captures what it is like to be a ten year old boy. Obsessed with guns, cars, and swear words. Not only does this movie do a great job of building character but the story is unique. Cop Car tells the tale of two young boys that come across a Cop Car in the middle of nowhere and take it for a joy ride.

            These boys have a familiar dynamic that has been used before but aside from that I found their relationship I found it realistic and believable. Making the two’s adventures enjoyable . The movie begins with the shorter boy telling the other boy to repeat the swear words he utters. This right away gives the feeling that there is an order. One is the leader and the other follows. This really hits the head on the nail with many groups of young boys. It seems there is always one who is willing to dare others and lead them into dangerous situations. Everyone involved enjoys what is happening and wants to take the next step, but there needs to be someone to nudge them into it. The childish aspect of the film is relatable and feels real. Many times I feel childhood relationships are idolized by cinema but Cop Car gave a good representation of a real childhood relationship.

            The plot is actually kind of absurd which makes it great. If I had found a cop car in the woods when I was ten I’m not sure if I would have driven away in it but you can bet I would have messed around with it. These kids are sort of intimidated at first but they dive head in eventually. What they get mixed up in is the slightly unlikely part.

            Kevin Bacon plays the cop who has his cop car stolen by the two kids. He fits right in to the new age cowboy role. The sheriff of a town that lies on the edge of the Great Plains and the base of the Rocky Mountains. With a mustache, a pickup truck, and two dogs. His character is placed within the duality of being a cop as well as a criminal. Having to show kindness to some and harshness to others. The character really is probably just a bad guy but there is definitely a likeable side to his character. Very similar to how the character Walter White feels in Breaking Bad. As always Kevin Bacon does a great job in his role.

            The scenery in the film is beautiful as you would expect from anywhere remotely close to the Rocky Mountains. The film puts the scenery to use in many shots of the kids walking across the landscape, and scenes out on the roads in the middle of nowhere. Cop Car is visually pleasing in scenery and filming. Many shots in the film create the anticipation expected from a thriller. In particular there is a point in the film where Kevin Bacon’s character is stealing a car. Ironic in the context of the film, but anyway the movie has you on the edge of your seat in a place where there is only some small amount of danger. It is a little over played but it does the job it was intended to do.

            I found the ending of this movie to be particularly well done. We don’t find out what happens to our main characters in the end but you can see what the next step will be. And while when movies are sometimes cut short and the open ending is frustrating this time it is very well done. If we were to know what happened the movie may be seen as too morbid, and since we do not know the movie is far less sad.

            The movie was directed by Jon Watts who is going to be directing the newest reversion of Spiderman. It is likely that this film helped land him that job and rightfully so. The film is well done. While it is cookie cutter in a way it also breaks its mold. Going beyond what is typically seen in theatres. Cop Car is a thriller at its core but also is an adventure and action movie. The movie builds suspense and characters nicely but not perfectly. It is hard to find something bad to say about the film while it is also hard to say anything that is outstanding about it. It was enjoyable and while it is not the greatest story in the world Cop Car is different enough that I feel it is worth the amount of time it takes to view, but not much more than that.
