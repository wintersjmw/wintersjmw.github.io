            Hello this Jake Winters for eye on the triangle this is snowverated and this week I will be taking a look at the film World’s greatest dad.

            This film was released in 2009 and was written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait. You may have heard of him before because he was Jimmy Kimmels director for a while as well as having his own stand-up comedy routine. Which if you have never seen or heard of his stand up before the only way I can explain it is hilarious insanity. World’s greatest dad is somewhat along the same lines. It is extremely cringey at parts but is hilarious when it tries to be.

            The main actor in this film was Robin Williams and for being as famous as he was this movie was far from popular when it was released which actually is understandable after seeing the film. Its fair to say that a lot of people if not most will not like this film. It is dark, a lot of the humor is crass, and the subject matter of the film is pretty touchy for a lot of people and rightfully so. The movie is essentially a parody of how high schools handle suicide so it can hit kind of close to home for a lot of people. But really with any comedy you have to be willing to laugh at yourself in order to understand it. A lot of people would say there is nothing to laugh about in this situation and obviously they have a point. Death tends to be pretty serious but there are so many comedies with death in them like it is nothing. Look at all the old cartoons, of course the characters never die permanently but they are so full of violence and what would normally be fatal experiences and those were comedy shows for children so there is something funny about death. My take is that death is so absurd that if you put it in the right light it casn be funny.

            The way robin Williams character is written was my favorite part of this movie. He is a push over guy who is raising his son who hates him by himself. Bobcat Goldthwait did an amazing job of showing exactly how that type of person reacts to conflict and challenge and that was an unexpectedly great thing about the movie. Almost all of the characters beside him are just archetypes which if you don’t catch at first, like I didn’t, the movie seems terrible. But the characters all being archetypes of some kind of teacher or teenager made this movie all the more terrible and hilarious.

            Everything about this movie seemed to be by the book. The filming and sets where extremely plain and just done well. It was sort of like watching a ABC Family drama but seriously distorted which is another thing I find hilarious about it. The whole movie really is a joke. When you start thinking abou the plot after watching the whole thing you see all these subtleties in how everything worked out that are just hilarious. I haven’t watched the movie again yet but I have a feeling that it is one of those movies that only gets better the more you watch it.

            It is hard to say whether I liked this film or not because of how genuinely strange it is. Throughout the movie I kept wanting to turn it off but it actually did a good job of keeping me hooked on where the story would go. It was like watching one of those movies that is so bad it is good but this movie was actually good somehow in the end. I think it was probably good because of how intentional everything was. If it was hard to tell that they had used archetypes for all of the characters it may have seemed like they were trying to make a somewhat serious Dark Comedy but it is almost like the movie didn’t even take itself seriously. World’s Greatest dad is a horribly great Dark Comedy that beside being terrible on the surface somehow managed to captivate me and make me laugh.

            I am going to give this movie a 2.5/5. I really liked this movie but I can’t give it a good score because it just isn’t filmed in any unique way and really is only unique because of it’s comedy which is what constitutes its whole score. I have seen this movie recommended in a few places before and there are a lot of opinions about whether it is good or not and I have to say that while I was watching it I leaned towards terrible but after finishing it something compels me to call it good.
