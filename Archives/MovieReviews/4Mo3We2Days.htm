		Hello this is Jake Winters for Eye on the Triangle this is snowverated and today I will be 
		taking a look at the film 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days. This film takes you on a wild ride of 
		emotion that I think conveys what a lot of people have tried to explain far better than words 
		ever could. This movie would be a good example of when film triumphs over written word. Unlike 
		were many adaptations of books into films far very far short.
		</p>

		The movie starts by keeping the reader deep in the dark about the subject. Something that isn&#39;t supposed
		to be going on is definitely going on. Money is brought up random people we have no reference for and the
		setting is odd to say the least. You wonder where you are for at least a good minute which is not unusual
		at the start of a film but not having setting and context of conversation is to say the least disorienting.
		Not only is the setting not immediately identifiable beside a room of two girls it is also within a foreign
		setting. The language spoken in the film is Romanian. Which I have to say is a very interesting language.
		It lies at the crossroads of Slavic and Romance. Containing the grammar of a romance language with many loan
		words from Slavic tongues. So beside the fact that you don&#39;t know where you are and you have not much of a
		clue as to what the characters are talking about the film is foreign. Of course not for all but in this
		context I feel safe saying that it will feel foreign. The area is a little beat down like many post-soviet
		countries are but it isn&#39;t unorganized and it isn&#39;t all falling apart, maybe just a little old is a better
		description. 
		</p>
		<p class = "indent">
		The film goes on for quite some time without revealing what is really going on but we find out the girls are
		students and that one of the girls has a boyfriend also attending class at the university. They lead very average
		lives, so the film begs the question what could they be doing that is so secretive. Surely it is not a big
		matter and rather they are exaggerating there problems. One thing I love about this movie is its use of title.
		So many works of art not just film forget to use their title effectively and this film does it in a beautiful way.
		They take that you must know the title of the film and use it as a way to pique your interest and provide a clue
		as to what they are talking about which I won&#39;t give away because it is a great aspect of the film.
		</p>
		<p class = "indent">
		Nothing really stands out about how the film does its shots really it is just well executed and doesn&#39;t try to draw 
		attention to its camera use. One shot in the film I really enjoyed was from the perspective of one of the main girls
		and really did a great job of telling story and switching perspective to whos perspective is really important at that 
		point in the movie. So beside the filming what really makes this film stand out is its story telling. Like I have
		highlighted so many times before the slow reveal is what truly makes this film a masterpiece on the whole, but the small
		scenes invoke in the audience the same emotion that our main character must be feeling so well throughout I have to 
		mention it. My favorite scene in the whole movie comes after the climax and is just when our main character is meeting 
		the parents of her boyfriend for the first time. It is such a drastic change in mood and you can&#39;t help but get just as
		annoyed as she does with their conversation that just drooooooones on. Like holy crap I really really wanted the scene to
		just be over. You just sit there watching the awkward encounter as our main character sits there silently dreading the
		whole process and progressively becoming more annoyed as you yourself become annoyed. Many films would have presented
		boring conversation for a little and then went back to entertainment but this films bores to fantastically make the point
		of the characters emotion.
		</p>

		Anyway If I haven&#39;t convinced you already this film is great. It won the palme d&#39;or at the cannes film festival in the
		year of its release and it was well deserved. Beautiful and unique method of storytelling and it has story that will make
		you question your own views and maybe leave having more sympathy for some of the other people that inhabit this big
		beautiful world we all love and hate.

		Thank you for listening to this weeks edition of eye on the triangle and snowverated. Four months three weeks and two days
		is a little harder to find out there physically but you can stream it. I hope you have a wonderful evening. I&#39;m Jake Winters
		and once again thanks for tuning in.
