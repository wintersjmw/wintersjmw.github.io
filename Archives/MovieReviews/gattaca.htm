            Hello this is Jacob Winters for eye on the triangle this is snowverated and today I will be taking a look at the film Gattaca.

            Gattaca is about a world where genetics have been mastered. When you want to have a child you first visit the geneticist and give him or her the specified traits you want your child to have and then they help you conceive that child. The story follows a man that was born in a natural fashion and how society views him.

            This movies premise poses a lot of questions and provides an interesting look into the future. I wondered when I heard the premise how a man could ever expect to compete with the best of mankind being born with any amount of defects. This is a logical question and the movie takes it head on. It challenges what people think about genetics in this future and says a lot about our current time in doing so. The main message it sends is to never let someone else determine your future. From the beginning of the movie to the end it is pretty obvious what is going to happen. When you hear the main characters dream at the beginning it is hard to see the story going anywhere else.

            The story isn’t bland though. The curveballs thrown in by future technology and the random chance of the world will always get in the way. The makers of Gattaca did a good job of making the story interesting. They took this world that many have envisioned before and looked at it from a criminal perspective. A very interesting way to do things. I like this aspect because I think almost everyone can agree that criminals are never going to go away and that the good ones are usually clever. Not that being clever means you should commit crimes but that is beside the point. They develop a whole system of how crime can happen in this world and the level of detail put into how the crime could be done is high and impressive. With this system of crime they built a lot of suspense. You never know wat might go wrong in the movie because this technology is foreign to us. The technology of the crime fighters is also unknown to the viewer which will generally make you think they have the upper hand.

            There is a lot attention to detail in terms of design of the movie. The letters ATCG, these represent the proteins that make up DNA, can be seen in the opening credits as well as in the title of the movie. This attention to detail is always what I like to see in movies. It doesn’t add anything to stories but shows or at least attempts to show ow much work was put into a movie. These kinds of things don’t make a movie but when added to a movie that is good it can make it great. There are other instances where the letters come up but I will leave it to you to find them. The design of many things in the movie are based on things from the 1950’s and 60’s. The period of the space race. It is interesting to see a future where they are dressing like a period from the past. It is sort of like if the world had just continued on from the 50’s til the future with space exploration and style. Either that or in the future there is a resurgence in 50’s and 60’s styles. It could even have been a result of what seems like a huge space program and wanting to be reminiscent of the time when it started. These details make the world seem all the more real.

            Some things of the plot felt forced like the mad up slang of the future. They call people that were not born with genetic altering DeGENEerates. This portmanteau is clever but it felt out of place. There were not too many others that I felt stuck out but even just this one threw off the story and made it feel slightly cheesy to me.

            I am going to give this movie a 7 out of 10 overall. I really enjoyed the concept and what they did with imagining the future in a different way but felt that the plot was a little too predictable. Even the major twist at the end was pretty predictable. But, just because a movie is predictable does not mean it is bad. This movie is all about believing in yourself and finding a value in yourself that society just doesn’t see. The style of the movie was enjoyable and I think it was just overall a slightly above average plot with a great premise.
